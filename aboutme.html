                        <p>In November 2019, I seized the moment to do something I've always wanted to do, and I booked myself into
                        an intership with The WinterSports Company to become a ski instructor in Canada. I had always wanted to
                        work for a ski season and figured I needed a career break, so I would go away for a few months and come 
                        back home. Instead this new job, my passion, had become so much more than I ever imagined!

                        <p>I always center my lesson around creating a comfortable environment where my clients can feel at ease and gradually build confidence.

                        <p>Confidence in your skiing can be a mental game, and sometimes knowing you have the right eqipment is half of the battle. </p><br><br>
                        <p>Wanting to expand my knowledge, I also work part-time in one of our local ski shops, Jardines.<br><br>
                        This has given me a deeper understanding of all the equipment we use whilst skiing, allowing me in turn
                    to pass that knowledge on to my clients and give you the confidence you're in safe hands.</p>
