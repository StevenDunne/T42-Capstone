# Welcome
Thank you for viewing my first ever website project. This was designed as a personal site for my Ski Instructor job, and later expanded in various tasks through my HyperionDev
bootcamp. This is why there is a fairly unusual products section, first used for learning the beginnings of state.

# Usage
To use the site, simply download the folder from here, and open the index.html
This will run the site locally within your browser
